# sortingTypes

This project is purely for educational purposes as a tool to learn, not intended for actual use.
This repo contains a project intended to test the speed of different sorting algorithms by sorting an array of n numbers. 

# Sort Algorithm List
List of sorting algorithm types found inside the repo, will be updated as more types are created
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort


  # Notes:
 - Each sort class extends a parent 'SortTools' class, a class that shares primary tools used in all classes.
 - The sorts are run from a file 'sortTest' which prints out time stats on each sort algorithm
 - 
 # Upcoming Features:
- Raw data file output
- Additional sort algorithms
- Scalable testing (e.g. 100 vs 1000 vs 10000 nuumbers)

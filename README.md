# sortingTypes


This repository is a collection of different sort algorithms. This project is purely for educational purposes as a tool to learn, not intended for actual use. 

# Sort Algorithm List
List of sorting algorithm types found inside the repo, will be updated as more types are created
  * Notes:
    * Each sort class extends a parent 'sortTools' class, a class that shares primary tools used in all classes

  * [COMPLETE]: Bubble sort 
    * Basic sort, each element is compared to its neighbor and swapped if it is larger
    * Displays an array with 100 integers ranging from 1-100
    * Prints a sorted array, using a bubble sort
    * Displays analytics on the sort time
  * [COMPLETE]: Selection sort
  	* Basic sort, iterate through the entire array finding the minimum, swapping with the first element if found
  	* Diplays an array with 100 integers ranging from 1-100
  	* Prints a sorted array, using a selection sort
  	* Displays analytics on the sort time
